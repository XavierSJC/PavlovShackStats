# Pavlov Shack Statistics

## Overview
This is a project has the objective to create a simple API to receive the stats files created by the game Pavlov Shack VR and make this data public.

## Disclaimer
This project was created using the data provided by the game Pavlov Shack VR, but I believe that the game Pavlov Shack has the same file format and this server could be used either.

## Structure
This project as the back-end `WebApplication1`, it provides the API and `react-client`, it provides a very simple interface to check the database and server information.
